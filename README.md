# Getting An Interview
### Networking
- Networking is the best way to get an interview! It helps you stand out among the masses. Attend [local tech meetups](https://www.meetup.com/cities/ca/bc/vancouver/tech/), go to career fairs and actually talk to recruiters there + follow up with them, and reach out to friends at companies you would like to work for to get a referral.
### LinkedIn
- If you don't know anyone at the company you want to work for and if they are not attending any events near you it is possible to have some success messaging recruiters on LinkedIn. USUALLY they will straight up ignore your messages, but SOMETIMES you can get an interview out of it! LinkedIn has this thing now where you might need to buy premium in order to message certain people. When I was job hunting I bought premium for this feature, but overall I do not think it was worth it. 
### Applying Online
- Applying online seems to have the lowest success rate, though it is still certainly possible to land an interview this way. NETWORK INSTEAD IF POSSIBLE!!!

# Study Guide
### Data Structures
- I have some detailed information about various data structures in [this document](https://github.com/lisageeee/InterviewPrep/blob/master/README.md). KNOW YOUR DATA STRUCTURES!!!!!!!!!! Know the time & space complexity and tradeoffs. Also know how to actually implement them from scratch. 
### [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- LeetCode (or a similar site) is the most important resource in preparing for interviews. 
- If you are preparing for a specific company (Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc.) it may be worth it to purchase LeetCode premium. It allows you to focus your studying on what is important for these places.
- Aim to do around 2-5 questions per day. 
- Start with the easy questions and work on only those for a few weeks and then go on to tackle some medium level questions. Unless you are applying for the Big 4 you probablyyy won't be asked hard level questions. Probably. 
- Work through the questions as if you were actually doing an interview. Talk out loud and explain to yourself what you are doing and why. Try to resist looking at other people's solutions and work through the problem on your own. If after around 20minutes you are still stuck you may take a look at a solution. Actually UNDERSTAND the solution. Don't just look at it and go "oh", comprehend what they are doing and why it works. 
- If you got stuck and had to look for a solution go back to the problem later and attempt it again with you new knowledge about how to solve the problem.
- If you are able to get the answer to a problem it is still a good idea to look at other people's solutions to see what you could improve on. 
- Try to stick to one category of problem for a few days at a time, it is easier to find patterns to questions that way. First do only array questions, then linked list questions, tree questions, etc.
- Don't give up! At first the easy questions will seem really hard and you may doubt yourself or want to look at the solution right away. Don't! It gets easier with time and the more questions you do the more similarities between questions you will find.
### [Sorting Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Comparison_of_algorithms)
- Try not to use insertion sort or bubble sort... Know about some of the more efficient sorting algorithms like Quick sort and Merge sort. Be prepared to explain why they are efficient.
- Know how to implement these algorithms. You may be asked to actually code Merge sort.
- Pro tip: in Java, Arrays.sort() uses Quick sort, so if you use this you know that complexity is O(nlogn).
### Search Algorithms
- Use an efficient search algorithm. Personally binary search came up a lot in my interviews - study that.
### [Complexity](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)
- Know the space & time complexity of the algorithm you have designed. You will almost always be asked this at the end. Brush up on your CPSC 221 & 320. 
### Design Questions
- You may be asked to design X. These questions can be very difficult as they are hard to practice for. Ask your interviewer specifically what they are looking for. They may want you to design an API, design a class hierarchy, or simply just talk through what you would do. It is highly variable depending on your interviewer. 
- Watch youtube videos of people working through these problems. It helps to see how others might approach these problems and also demonstrates the variability of the answers. I found [this user](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA8lYuzFlBqAy6dkZHj5VxUAaqr4vwrka) very helpful.
### Info About Your Language of Choice
- Know details about the language of your choice. If you are progamming in an OO language at the minimum you should know what abstraction and polymorphism is. 
- Sometimes you might get asked questions comparing two languages (Ex. What are some differences between C and Java?)
## Before the Interview
- Find out from your recruiter what the format of the interview will be. It could be behavioural questions, system design questions, or data structure/algorithm questions. Or it could be a mix of these! It is important to know so that you can be prepared.
- Study more!! It doesn't hurt to be overprepared.
- Sleep & eat. Sometimes it is hard to sleep before an important interview. If you can't sleep well before an interview it might be ok and you can use caffeine and adreneline to survive..but it is definitely not ideal. 
- Wear an outfit that makes you feel confident. Often companies will say that it doesn't matter what you wear to the interview. That doesn't mean you should look sloppy though. Look nice! 

# During the Interview
1) Understand the question! If there is anything unclear ask the interviewer about it! Never assume anything. A lot of times you will be asked intentionally vague questions and it is your job to seek clarity. For example you may be asked to sort a list. Some questions to ask might be: 
- What type of list? Array list? Linked list?
- Should I sort it in place?
- What am I sorting? Numbers? Strings?
- If you are sorting numbers are they integers? Floats?
- Am I sorting in ascending or descending order?

2) Think back to your time studying and try to determine whether you have seen a similar problem before. If you have what did you do for that problem? 

3) Before you begin coding work through some potential approaches to the problem out loud. Often times your first idea will not be the optimal approach, but it is important to state it anyway to show the interviewer your thought process and knowledge of various data structures/algorithms. This is also important so that your interviewer can help guide you on the right track or offer any help if you get lost or if something is not quite right with your approach. Don't be afraid to ask for a bit of help if you are stuck. Also, if the interviewer gives you a hint TAKE THE HINT. They are giving it to you for a reason! 

4) Once you have come up with an approach that you and your interviewer are satisfied with you may begin coding. Don't stop talking while you are coding!! First code a working solution and afterwards you can optimize.

5) You will usually have around 30minutes to code a solution to one or more problems. When you run out of time it is good to explain what you would do with the code if you had more time. For example, you can explain how you might optimize it further or how you might make it more readable. 

# After the Interview
- Don't assume the worst. Often times you performed a lot better than you thought you did!
- Thank your recruiter and interviewer(s) if you know their contact information.
- Follow up for results if you don't hear anything after a week or so.
