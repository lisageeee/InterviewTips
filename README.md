## Getting An Interview
### Networking
- Networking is the best way to get an interview! It helps you stand out among the masses. Attend [local tech meetups](https://www.meetup.com/cities/ca/bc/vancouver/tech/), go to career fairs and actually talk to recruiters there + follow up with them, and reach out to friends at companies you would like to work for to get a referral.
### LinkedIn
- If you don't know anyone at the company you want to work for and if they are not attending any events near you, it is possible to have some success messaging recruiters on LinkedIn. USUALLY they will straight up ignore your messages, but SOMETIMES you can get an interview out of it! LinkedIn has this thing now where you might need to buy premium in order to message certain people. When I was job hunting I bought premium for this feature, but overall I do not think it was worth it. 
### Applying Online
- Applying online seems to have the lowest success rate, though it is still certainly possible to land an interview this way. NETWORK INSTEAD IF POSSIBLE!!!

## Study Guide
### Arrays
### LinkedLists
### Stacks/Queues
### Heaps
### Trees
### Sorting Algorithms
### Searching Algorithms
### Dynamic Programming
### Complexity
### Design Questions
### Info About Your Language of Choice
- Know details about the language of your choice. If you are progamming in an OO language at the minimum you should know what abstraction and polymorphism is. 
- Sometimes you might get asked questions comparing two languages (Ex. What are some differences between C and Java?)

## Before the Interview
- Find out from your recruiter what the format of the interview will be. It could be behavioural questions, system design questions, or data structure/algorithm questions. Or it could be a mix of these! It is important to know so that you can be prepared.
- Study more!! It doesn't hurt to be overprepared.
- Sleep & eat. Sometimes it is hard to sleep before an important interview. If you can't sleep well before an interview it might be ok and you can use caffeine and adreneline to survive..but it is definitely not ideal. 
- Wear an outfit that makes you feel confident. Often companies will say that it doesn't matter what you wear to the interview. That doesn't mean you should look sloppy though. Look nice! 

## During the Interview
1) Understand the question! If there is anything unclear ask the interviewer about it! A lot of times you will be asked intentionally vague questions and it is your job to seek clarity. For example you may be asked to sort a list. Some questions to ask might be: 
- What type of list? Array list? Linked list?
- Should I sort it in place?
- What am I sorting? Numbers? Strings?
- If you are sorting numbers are they integers? Floats?
- Am I sorting in ascending or descending order?

2) Before you begin coding work through some potential approaches to the problem out loud. Often times your first idea will not be the optimal approach, but it is important to state it anyway to show the interviewer your thought process and knowledge of various data structures/algorithms. This is also important so that your interviewer can help guide you on the right track or offer any help if you get lost or if something is not quite right with your approach. Don't be afraid to ask for a bit of help if you are stuck. Also, if the interviewer gives you a hint TAKE THE HINT. They are giving it to you for a reason! 

3) Once you have come up with an approach that you and your interviewer are satisfied with you may begin coding. Don't stop talking while you are coding!! First code a working solution and afterwards you can optimize.

4) You will usually have around 30minutes to code a solution to one or more problems. When you run out of time it is good to explain what you would do with the code if you had more time. For example, you can explain how you might optimize it further or how you might make it more readable.
